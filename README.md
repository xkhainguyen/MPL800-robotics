# MPL800-robotics
My project in the course Robot Engineering at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.
I imported MPL800 robotic manipulator model from CAD files to Simulink/Simscape. Then I used PID to control the joint variables. The visualization is outstanding.
Please give me a ‚≠ê if you find it useful.
